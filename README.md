# python-principles

[pythonprinciples.com](pythonprinciples.com) is a website for learning python through *actually* programming. 

I'm a big fan of this style of learning and I wanted some evidence for the python skills I have built over the last year, so I have created a repo to catalogue my [solutions](https://github.com/geraldwogan/python-principles/blob/dev/challenges.py) to their [challenges](https://pythonprinciples.com/challenges/). 

I have also compiled a series of [tests](https://github.com/geraldwogan/python-principles/blob/dev/test_challenges.py) using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/), writing these tests will hopefilly result in a deeper understanding of each challenge and their requirements for success.
